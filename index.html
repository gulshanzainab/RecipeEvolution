				<h2>Recipe Evolution</h2>
				<p>A chef's success directly relates to the taste and nutritional values of recipes that he/she proposes.  Formulating new recipes is more of an art than a science. Machine Learning and commercial AI have proved their significance in many fields from the last few decades, including bio-informatics, medical imaging, and data mining. Similarly, machine-generated recipes are not out of the question, and one can develop computer programs that can float novel recipes rich in taste and nutritional values.  The major hurdle in such developments is the lack of resources in machine-readable ingredients, instructions, and nutritional values.  In this project titled â€œRecipe Evolution," we will create a software application that will be using a large dataset of recipes from all over the world to intelligently generate new and improved recipes having not only great taste but will also contain required nutritional value.</p>

		<h2>Evolution and Evolutionary Algorithms</h2>
		<p>Evolutionary algorithms are algorithms that are based on species evolution; in general, they are based on Charles Darwin's basic evolutionary theory. The implementation of evolutionary mechanisms varies considerably; yet, the essential concept behind all of these variants is the same. The presence of a population of individuals exposed to environmental pressure is defined by evolutionary algorithms, which leads to natural selection, i.e. the survival of the fittest, and, as a result, an increase in the population's average fitness. Fitness is a statistic for how well an organism adapts to its surroundings; the higher the fitness, the more fit and adaptable the organism is to its surroundings. In general, evolutionary algorithms only consider a subset of mechanisms that have evolved during the span of biological evolution.</p>
