				<h2>Features of Recipe Evolution</h2>
				<p>A recipe evolution form is an essential tool for a chef to maintain consistency within his restaurant. Without regular evaluations of existing recipes on the menu a variety of issues will crop up which will affect the consistency of your recipes and the guest's satisfaction. However, this paper is set to highlight what is evaluated in a meal, defining the standards and spectation of the prepared dishes.<br>One of the most evident things which happens is that the cooks will either alter the recipes to fit their own flavor profiles, or they will alter them to make their lives easier, taking shortcuts which will change the quality of the overall product. Hence, it is human nature to take the easiest path and the staff will alter the recipes in order to make their lives easier unless they consistently double check what they are producing. Another reason for regular recipe evaluations is that as the seasons change so do the flavor profiles of the ingredients. Likewise, evaluate the characteristics of food, as perceived by the five senses appearance, aroma, taste, texture and consistency. Define your standards and expectations for each dish and check if the prepared dish matches up.<br>The appearance of the ingredients has to be evaluated. the appearance aspects includes color and color combinations, sizes and shapes of ingredients, visual attractiveness, eye appeal, signs of freshness, aroma (the smell or aroma such as tangy, herby, earthy), taste (the basic sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami tastes) texture and consistency (the qualities felt with the finger, tongue, palate or teeth, temperature (knowing the right temperature to serve dishes such as hot, cold and room temperature) as well as flavor which refer to the combination of aroma, texture, temperature and taste reacting with saliva.
					For color, texture and taste evaluations, place samples in clean, uncontaminated containers and assign codes when evaluating more than one sample and use separate food samples for each evaluator. When evaluating aroma, place sample at least 1 inch from the nose. When evaluating taste, bite off a small portion of the sample and chew slowly. When evaluating more than one dish, spit out the sample after tasting and rinse mouth with tap water.</p>

		<h2>Advantages</h2>
		<p><li>There is strong scientific evidence - physiological, fossil and bio-geographical - to support Darwin's ideas</li>
			<li>Since the 19th century, when Darwin forwarded his theories advances in scientific understanding have clarified and reinforced his ideas on natural selection</li>
			<li>Richard Dawkins, and eminent biologist, has shown that life can develop itself into increasingly complex forms and totally rejects the idea of an external designer</li>
			<li>Evidence from geologists and paleontologists also support the process of evolution</li>
			<li>Some Christians have used Darwin's theory to reinforce their idea of God as an ever-working God rather than a God who occasionally 'interferes' in the universe he created</li>
			<li>Some Christians believe that God started the process of evolution. The probability of life starting by chance,they claim is virtually impossible</li></p>

		<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<p>
<li>The theory of evolution is criticized for a lack of evidence including missing links and inconsistencies</li>
<li>It is a theory and not a fact</li>
<li>The history of science shows how theories can change and in some cases be discarded altogether</li>
<li>Creationists also argue that science has limitations and that it has been very wrong in the past</li>
<li>Science is unable to provide a complete account of the origin of life. There is still a lack of comprehensive agreement on how natural selection began</li>
<li>The human brain, which greatly exceeds the demands required by the evolutionary process, gives credence to the idea that human beings were made special by God</li>
<li>It only tells us how life originated, it doesn't tell us why. It offers nothing for the greater understanding about the purpose of life</li>
